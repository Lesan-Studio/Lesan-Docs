You will go to billing and pay based on the text size, and you'll get the transcribed audio in your email in a few hours.

Want to event take it a step further and build your own audio style and dialect maybe for your region or your next YouTube Ad?

**EASY AGAIN!** - go to **<https://lesan.studio/custom-style-building>** we have all sorts of expert guidance to help build your speaker that you can use over and over again with a fraction of a cost you'd pay for actual voice actors.
