# Have you heard the story of Ubuntu?

- There was once a white journalist who ventured into the depth of the South African community to find out more about the people and their culture. He was so intrigued by what he learned he decided to write about it and made a word that we use often today called Ubuntu.

- The story goes like this. This journalist would see a group of kids playing a game and they seem unmotivated. To lift up their spirits, he would tell the kids who ever wins the race would get 10$.

- To his surprise, he didn't see children racing to make it to the finish line, or kids fighting each other to excel ahead from the gang. But instead, he saw the kids climbing each other and making a one person conglomeration. Baffled by the sight of this, he decided to keep quiet and see what they were up to. Everyone made it to the finish line equally.

- At the end of the race, they came to collect their prize money. Everybody was a winner, but this westerner was confused and he asked them why they did what they did. They all screamed - UBUNTU!

- When one of us wins, we all win. Working for a common good and a common purpose gives the highest success rate and the highest satisfaction.
