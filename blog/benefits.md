# TTS Benefits for End Users

Text to speech has benefits for everyone and here are some points that break down how specific groups see a better user experience:

- **Extend the reach of your content** – TTS gives access to your content to a greater population, such as those with literacy difficulties, learning disabilities, reduced vision and those learning a language.
- **Accessibility is relevant** – Making your online content audible helps the online population to better understand the text. The text is read and highlighted simultaneously so that the reader may easily follow along.
- **Populations are evolving** – 244 million people are foreign born across the globe (an increase of 70 million since 2000).
- **A growing elderly population depends on technology** – Making digital content on the Internet accessible in multiple forms creates an easier user experience.
- **People are increasingly mobile and looking for convenience** – In the US, a growing share of time spent on digital content is on mobile devices and the demand for connected devices continues to rise on a worldwide scale.
- **People with different learning styles** – Some people are auditory learners, some are visual learners, and some are kinesthetic learners – most learn best through a combination of the three.
